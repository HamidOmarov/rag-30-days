## 🧠 Goal

To build a production-ready RAG pipeline in 30 days and land a remote AI job by the end of the sprint.

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python
- LangChain
- ChromaDB / Weaviate / FAISS
- OpenAI API
- Streamlit (optional UI)
- Git & GitHub

## 📈 Progress

Check commits and folders daily to follow the sprint. Each folder corresponds to 1 day of learning and building.

## 📅 Day 1 – Getting Started with Python & Flask

### ✅ What I Learned
- Refreshed core **Python basics** (variables, functions, classes, etc.)
- Built my first **Flask API** with real-world JSON responses
- Practiced structured coding with **Copilot assistance**

### 🛠️ What I Built
- `hello_ai.py`: A minimal Python script to print a welcome message
- `api.py`: A Flask application with 3 endpoints:
  - `/hello`: greeting message
  - `/calculate`: accepts 2 numbers (POST) and returns their sum
  - `/ai-ready`: motivational message for AI learning

### 🔮 Tomorrow's Plan
- Begin **LangChain** setup and environment configuration
- Start working on **RAG-based document processing**
- Set up folder structure and `day2` workflow

> 👣 One day down, 29 to go. Keep shipping.
